#### Problem Description
In places with a limited amount of character space, people will often resort to keywords in order to express their thoughts. 
The keyword replacement tool finds abbreviations in text passages and replaces them with the proper phrases. For example if a text passage included the string “ASAP” then the tool will replace this with “as soon as possible”.

#### Edge Cases
- Multiple keywords with no space in between
- Mistypes in keywords
- Different typing habits (with or without certain punctuation marks)
- Upper and lower cases irregularities
- Keywords within a word ("ily" which stands for "i love you" in "luckily")

#### Expected Complexities
Some of our group members have only collaborated on coding projects a handful of times so far, so getting ourselves ready to work together over Github will be a challenge. Our project experience is also limited so building something of this scope may be a little overwhelming for our members.

We expect issues to pop up in terms of scheduling. We cannot expect our members to dedicate 100% of their time to the project, so we hope to start well in advance in case of delays.

#### Dataset Collection
Course provided dataset.

#### Programming Language
Our group members have less experience with Python, so Java will be our language of choice. We will use GitHub to host our repository and we have a private Discord server to facilitate communication.

#### Task Separation and Responsibilities
We hope to divide up the work equally as we start. We do not have a good grasp on the limits of everyone’s skills as of yet, but as we work we will be able to more accurately determine our skills. Once that occurs, we can distribute the workload so everyone can apply their skills to the best of their ability. 

#### Unexpected Cases/Difficulties
None at the moment.
